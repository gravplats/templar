How to build the project
------------------------

The project uses [psake](https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake) by [James Kovacs](http://jameskovacs.com/) to manage the build process. psake is a Windows PowerShell based build tool and is included in the project as a NuGet package.

The project can be built by executing build script.

	> .\build.ps1

This will build the default task which is the build task. To build any other task (clean, build, nuget) run the following command.

	> .\build.ps1 [task]

Note: You may need to allow script execution by running the following command as an administrator in PowerShell

	> Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Please refer to the [psake](https://github.com/JamesKovacs/psake) project for further information.
